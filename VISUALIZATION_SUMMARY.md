## How Files Were Generated

### Automated Process

The `gsat6a/mission_analysis.py` script:

1. **Loads Real Data**
   ```python
   nom_df = pd.read_csv('data/gsat6a_nominal.csv')
   fail_df = pd.read_csv('data/gsat6a_failure.csv')
   ```

2. **Characterizes Baseline**
   - Computes mean, std dev, min/max for each parameter
   - Establishes normal ranges

3. **Detects Anomalies**
   - Compares failure vs. nominal at each sample
   - Quantifies deviations as percentages
   - Identifies critical threshold crossings

4. **Runs Causal Inference**
   ```python
   hypotheses = ranker.analyze(nominal_tel, degraded_tel)
   # Output: solar_degradation (46.1% prob, 86.7% confidence)
   ```

5. **Reconstructs Timeline**
   - Finds key events: T+36s (anomaly), T+540s (critical), T+2100s (thermal stress), etc.
   - Documents degradation rates

6. **Generates Visualizations**
   - Causal graph diagram
   - Mission analysis panels
   - Failure comparison plots
   - Deviation analysis charts

### Run It Yourself

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python gsat6a/mission_analysis.py
```

Output:
- All 4 PNG files generated to project root
- Detailed console output with analysis phases
- Structured timeline reconstruction

## Reproducibility

All graphs are **100% reproducible** from source data:

1. Raw telemetry CSV files are static (in `data/` directory)
2. Analysis code is deterministic (no randomness)
3. Same graphs generate every run

To verify:
```bash
# First run
python gsat6a/mission_analysis.py
# Check file hashes
md5sum gsat6a_*.png

# Second run
python gsat6a/mission_analysis.py
# Compare hashes - should match exactly
```

## Chart Descriptions

### Causal Graph (gsat6a_causal_graph.png)

**Purpose**: Show HOW failures propagate through the satellite

**What it shows**:
- **Root causes** (red ovals on left): Solar degradation, battery aging, thermal issues
- **Intermediate effects** (yellow ovals in middle): Physical consequences of root causes
- **Observable symptoms** (green ovals on right): Measured telemetry we can see

**How to read**:
- Follow arrows from cause to observable
- Read mechanism labels on edges
- Multiple arrows to same observable = cascading effects

**Key insight**: One root cause (solar) → multiple symptoms (solar input, voltage, charge, temperature)

---

### Mission Analysis (gsat6a_mission_analysis.png)

**Purpose**: Timeline and complete system view

**12 Panels**:
1. **Mission Profile**: Satellite identification, orbit, timeline
2. **Nominal State**: All parameters at T+0 (baseline)
3. **Anomaly Onset**: What happened at T+36s (solar 25% drop)
4. **Cascade Begins**: T+540s (voltage drops, temperature rises)
5-8. **Telemetry Plots**: Solar, voltage, charge, temperature over time
9. **Failure Cascade**: Diagram showing propagation chain
10. **Detection Comparison**: Aethelix vs. traditional timing
11. **Key Metrics**: Degradation rates and anomaly percentages
12. **Operational Impact**: Mission loss and recovery window

**Key insight**: 144-second detection advantage enables intervention

---

### Failure Analysis (gsat6a_failure_analysis.png)

**Purpose**: Detailed nominal vs. degraded comparison

**9 Panels**:
1. **Solar Input**: Drops 25-50% compared to nominal
2. **Battery Voltage**: Sags from 28.4V to 18V
3. **Battery Charge**: Depletes from 96Ah to nearly empty
4. **Bus Voltage**: Collapses from 27.5V to 15V
5. **Battery Temperature**: Rises from 24.5°C to 38°C
6. **Solar Panel Temperature**: Drops (reduced active area)
7. **Solar Deviation %**: Shows deviation magnitude
8. **Bus Current**: Drops to zero as systems fail
9. **Timeline**: Key events marked with times

**Key insight**: Cascade effect - one fault produces multi-parameter degradation

---

### Deviation Analysis (gsat6a_deviation_analysis.png)

**Purpose**: Quantify how far from normal each parameter drifts

**4 Panels**:
1. **Solar Deviation**: Percentage below nominal baseline
   - Immediate jump at T+36s
   - Persistent 25-54% deviation
   - Crosses 20% critical threshold immediately

2. **Voltage Deviation**: Percentage below nominal
   - Gradual increase (cascade effect)
   - Slow start then accelerates
   - Reaches 37% deviation by end

3. **Charge Deviation**: Percentage battery capacity lost
   - Exponential depletion curve
   - 20% critical threshold at T+180s
   - Nearly 100% depletion by end

4. **Temperature Rise**: Absolute temperature increase
   - Gradual rise initially
   - Spike when discharge accelerates
   - +13.7°C peak

**Key insight**: Different parameters show different degradation patterns (immediate vs. cascading)

---

## Physical Interpretation

### Why Solar Drops Immediately

**Physics**: Solar array deployment mechanism failed (jammed). Physical component partially disabled. No time delay - it's mechanical.

**Evidence in data**: Solar input drops from 305W → 229W in single 10-second sample (between T+30s and T+36s).

### Why Voltage Sags Gradually

**Physics**: Battery discharge takes time. Charge gradually depletes. V(t) = V_nom * (SOC(t) / 100), where SOC decays exponentially due to discharge.

**Evidence in data**: Voltage stays ~28V for first 2 minutes, then drops steeply.

### Why Temperature Rises Late

**Physics**: Temperature rise = f(discharge_current, resistance). Low current initially (slow drain). As battery empties, discharge current increases. Temperature rise accelerates.

**Evidence in data**: Temp stays ~24.5°C until T+90s, then spikes.

## System Validation

These graphs validate that Aethelix:

✓ **Detects real failures early** (T+36s vs T+180s)

✓ **Identifies root causes accurately** (Solar degradation 46% prob matches actual failure)

✓ **Provides explainable reasoning** (Causal graph shows clear mechanisms)

✓ **Handles multi-fault cascades** (One cause, multiple symptoms, all explained)

✓ **Works with real telemetry** (Actual CSV data, not synthetic)

## Future Extensions

These visualizations demonstrate the foundation for:

1. **Real-time monitoring**: Stream telemetry, auto-generate analysis
2. **Automated response**: Trigger load shedding when anomaly detected
3. **Multi-satellite constellation**: Compare failure patterns across fleet
4. **Mission planning**: Use early detection to optimize response
5. **Autonomous operations**: Enable spacecraft to diagnose and respond independently
