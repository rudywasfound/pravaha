Causal Inference for Multi-Fault Satellite Failures

In one line:

Given satellite telemetry with multiple simultaneous degradations, infer the most likely root causes instead of just flagging correlations.

This is something ISRO does not formally have as a framework.

Why This Is Genuinely Novel (No Hype)

Most satellite health systems:

Assume single-fault

Use threshold or correlation checks

Rely on humans to infer causality

Your work explicitly tackles:

Multi-fault scenarios

Confounding effects

Causal attribution, not correlation

That’s research-level.

What You Will ACTUALLY Build (Concrete)
1️⃣ A Causal Graph of a Satellite

You will manually define a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG):

Example (simplified):

Solar Input ──▶ Battery State ──▶ Bus Voltage ──▶ Payload Health
      │                               ▲
      └────────▶ Thermal State ───────┘


This graph encodes engineering knowledge, not learned magic.

2️⃣ A Multi-Fault Telemetry Simulator

You simulate scenarios like:

Battery aging + partial solar panel shadowing

Thermal drift + sensor bias

Power degradation causing comms dropouts

This is critical — real multi-fault data is rare.

3️⃣ Causal Reasoning Algorithms (Math-Light, Logic-Heavy)

You will implement 3 approaches and compare them:

A. Correlation-based (Baseline)

Pearson / lagged correlations

This will fail under multi-faults (intentionally)

B. Rule-Based Causal Reasoning

Use graph traversal

Propagate effects upstream

Score candidate root causes

C. Probabilistic Causal Inference (Lightweight)

Bayesian belief updates on the graph

No heavy math derivations — libraries + logic

The novelty comes from comparison under controlled experiments.

4️⃣ Root Cause Ranking Output

Your system outputs:

Likely Root Causes:
1. Battery degradation (P=0.62)
2. Reduced solar input (P=0.27)
3. Thermal sensor bias (P=0.11)


And explains why.

Validation (This Is Where It Becomes “Research”)

You will ask:

How often does correlation get it wrong?

How much does causal reasoning improve accuracy?

How does performance degrade with missing data?

These are quantitative claims.

Deliverables (Non-Negotiable)

Reproducible simulator

Causal inference engine

Experimental results

Paper-style report (ICRA / AIAA-style)

Clean, public codebase

Math Reality Check (Important for You)

You said you’re weak at math and hate it.

Here’s the honest breakdown:

✔ Graphs, probabilities, conditionals

✔ Bayesian updates (conceptual, not proofs)

❌ No measure theory

❌ No hardcore stats

You can absolutely use LLMs + libraries here.

What matters is experimental rigor, not equations.

Why ISRO Would Care (Long Term)

This work:

Improves post-launch anomaly investigations

Reduces human bias in failure analysis

Scales to larger constellations

Fits ISRO’s conservative, explainable culture

They may not deploy it tomorrow — but they will read it.

Reality Check (I Won’t Lie)

This path:

Takes discipline

Requires careful thinking

Will feel slow at first

But it is far more defensible than generic AI work.
