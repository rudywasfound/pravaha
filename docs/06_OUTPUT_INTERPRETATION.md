ROOT CAUSE RANKING ANALYSIS
========================================================================

Most Likely Root Causes (by posterior probability):

1. solar_degradation         P= 46.3%  Confidence=93.3%
   Evidence: solar_input deviation, battery_charge deviation
   Mechanism: Reduced solar input is propagating through the power 
   subsystem. This suggests solar panel degradation or shadowing, which 
   reduces available power for charging the battery.

2. battery_aging             P= 18.8%  Confidence=71.7%
   Evidence: battery_charge deviation, battery_voltage deviation
   Mechanism: Aged battery cells have reduced capacity and efficiency,
   causing lower voltage and charge retention.

3. battery_thermal           P= 18.7%  Confidence=75.0%
   Evidence: battery_temp deviation, battery_voltage deviation
   Mechanism: Excessive battery temperature increases internal resistance,
   reducing charging efficiency and output voltage.

4. sensor_bias               P= 16.3%  Confidence=75.0%
   Evidence: battery_voltage deviation
   Mechanism: Sensor calibration drift could cause all voltage readings
   to be systematically offset, explaining the deviation.

## Report Components Explained

### Root Cause Ranking

**Format:**
```
[Rank]. [Cause Name]     P= [Probability]%   Confidence=[Confidence]%
Evidence: [What deviations support this]
Mechanism: [English explanation]
```

#### Probability (P)
- **What it means**: Posterior probability that this cause explains the observed anomalies
- **Range**: 0-100%
- **Important**: Probabilities sum to 100% across all hypotheses
- **Interpretation**:
  - P > 70%: Very likely, act on this hypothesis
  - P = 30-70%: Possible, needs investigation
  - P < 10%: Unlikely, but don't completely rule out

**Example:**
- P = 46.3% means there's a 46.3% chance solar_degradation explains what we observe
- It's the most likely cause, but not certain (not 90%+)

#### Confidence
- **What it means**: How certain we are about this probability (not about the cause itself)
- **Range**: 0-100%
- **Calculation**: Based on evidence quality and consistency with the causal graph
- **Interpretation**:
  - Confidence > 80%: Strong evidence, high trust in ranking
  - Confidence = 50-80%: Moderate evidence, reasonable trust
  - Confidence < 50%: Weak evidence, low trust in ranking

**Important distinction:**
```
High probability + High confidence: "This is probably the cause, and we're sure"
High probability + Low confidence: "This looks likely, but the evidence is weak"
Low probability + High confidence: "This is unlikely, but if true, we're sure"
```

#### Evidence
- **What it means**: Which measured variables support this hypothesis
- **How it works**: The framework traces paths through the causal graph and identifies variables that would change if this cause were active
- **Example**: If solar degradation is true, we expect:
  - Lower solar_input (direct cause)
  - Lower battery_charge (consequence of lower input)
  - Potentially higher battery_temp (consequence of longer discharge)

#### Mechanism
- **What it means**: English-language explanation of how this cause produces the effects
- **Not a formula**: These are textual descriptions that help operators understand the reasoning
- **Examples**:
  - "Reduced solar input -> lower available power -> slower battery charging -> lower battery charge percentage"
  - "Aged battery cells -> reduced capacity -> lower voltage output -> bus voltage drop"

### Anomaly Detection Report

Shows which sensors have unusual readings compared to nominal operation.

**Format:**
```
[Variable]    Deviation: [Absolute]  ([Percentage])  Onset: [Time]
```

**Deviation: Absolute Change**
- Measured value minus nominal value
- Same units as the variable
- Example: -59.47 W means 59.47 W lower than normal

**Deviation: Percentage Change**
- (Measured - Nominal) / Nominal  x  100%
- Easier to compare across variables with different scales
- Example: -9.91% means 9.91% lower than nominal

**Onset Time**
- When the anomaly first became significant (>threshold)
- Helpful for correlating with events or fault injection times
- Example: 6.48h means anomaly started 6.48 hours into the mission

**Severity Score**
- Overall quantification of how wrong the system is
- Aggregate across all anomalies
- 0% = completely nominal
- 100% = completely failed
- 20.68% = roughly 1/5 of the way to complete failure

## Visualization Output

### Telemetry Comparison Plot (comparison.png)

Two panels, side-by-side comparison:

```
LEFT PANEL: NOMINAL                RIGHT PANEL: DEGRADED
+------------------------+         +------------------------+
| Solar Input (W)        |         | Solar Input (W)        |
|  600 --------------    |         |  600 ------------      |
|      |     (down)DROP       |         |      | RED ZONE (fault) |
|  400                   |         |  400 +----------        |
|      +----------------->|         |      +-----------------> |
+------------------------+         +------------------------+
| Battery Charge (%)     |         | Battery Charge (%)     |
|  100 ------------      |         |  100 --------          |
|      |                 |         |      | (down)SLOW RECOVERY  |
|   50 +-----------------|         |   50 +--------------    |
+------------------------+         +------------------------+
| ... (6 more variables) |         | ... (6 more variables) |
+------------------------+         +------------------------+
| Time (hours) ->         |         | Time (hours) ->         |
+------------------------+         +------------------------+
```

**How to read it:**
1. **Left panel**: What healthy operation looks like (baseline)
2. **Right panel**: What we actually observed
3. **Red shaded area**: Period when faults were injected (if known)
4. **Deviations**: Differences between left and right panels

**What to look for:**
- **Timing**: When do variables change?
- **Magnitude**: How much do they deviate?
- **Relationships**: Do multiple variables change together (correlated)?
- **Recovery**: Do variables recover after the fault period?

**Example interpretation:**
```
TIME: 6 hours
LEFT:  Solar input stays ~600W (steady)
RIGHT: Solar input drops to ~400W (and stays low)

CONCLUSION: Solar fault appears to start at t=6h and persists
```

### Residual Analysis Plot (residuals.png)

Shows deviation magnitude over time:

```
RESIDUAL (DEVIATION)
    100 W |                          /\/\/\
     50 W |           (down)FAULT       /\
       0 W |----------------------
     -50 W |                   \/\/
    -100 W |
          +------------------------------> Time (hours)
            0h        6h         24h
```

**What this shows:**
- How far each variable is from nominal
- Positive deviation = higher than nominal
- Negative deviation = lower than nominal
- Magnitude = how abnormal the system is

**What to look for:**
1. **Start time**: When does deviation become significant?
2. **Magnitude**: How big is the deviation?
3. **Trend**: Does it worsen, stabilize, or improve?
4. **Correlations**: Do multiple variables deviate together?

**Example:**
```
Solar input residual: starts at 0, drops at t=6h to -400W, stays there
Battery charge residual: stays near 0 until t=6h, then slowly decreases

INTERPRETATION: Solar fault directly causes battery to discharge
```

## Confidence Intervals

When reported:
```
solar_degradation: 46.3%  +-  5.2%
```

This means:
- **Point estimate**: 46.3% probability
- **Uncertainty**:  +- 5.2% (confidence interval)
- **Range**: 41.1% - 51.5% (95% confidence interval)

Wider interval = less confident in the exact probability
Narrower interval = more confident in the exact probability

## Decision Rules

### For Operators

**Rule 1: Single high-confidence hypothesis**
```
IF P > 60% AND Confidence > 80%
THEN: Trust this diagnosis, take action based on mechanism
```

**Rule 2: Multiple plausible hypotheses**
```
IF multiple causes have P > 20%
THEN: Ambiguous diagnosis, collect more data or request diagnostics
```

**Rule 3: Low confidence overall**
```
IF max(Confidence) < 50%
THEN: Weak evidence, system may be partially masked
```

### For Automated Systems

**Automated Response**
```python
def get_recommended_action(hypotheses):
    best = hypotheses[0]
    
    if best.probability > 0.7 and best.confidence > 0.8:
        if best.name == "solar_degradation":
            return "rotate_solar_panels"
        elif best.name == "battery_thermal":
            return "reduce_power_load"
        elif best.name == "battery_aging":
            return "plan_battery_replacement"
    
    elif best.probability > 0.4:
        return "request_manual_investigation"
    
    else:
        return "no_action_continue_monitoring"
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Single Root Cause

```
solar_degradation: P=70%, Confidence=85%
battery_aging:     P=15%, Confidence=60%
battery_thermal:   P=15%, Confidence=60%
```

**Interpretation**: One dominant hypothesis explains observations well

**What to do**: Act on solar_degradation diagnosis

### Pattern 2: Multi-fault Ambiguity

```
solar_degradation: P=40%, Confidence=65%
battery_aging:     P=35%, Confidence=60%
battery_thermal:   P=25%, Confidence=55%
```

**Interpretation**: Multiple causes could explain observations

**What to do**: 
1. Request additional diagnostics
2. Isolate each subsystem
3. Inject test signals to disambiguate

### Pattern 3: Weak Signal

```
solar_degradation: P=25%, Confidence=40%
battery_aging:     P=25%, Confidence=40%
battery_thermal:   P=25%, Confidence=40%
sensor_bias:       P=25%, Confidence=40%
```

**Interpretation**: Evidence is too weak, system behavior is ambiguous

**What to do**:
1. Wait for more data accumulation
2. Check for sensor faults
3. Verify nominal baseline is correct

### Pattern 4: High Confidence, Low Probability

```
solar_degradation: P=15%, Confidence=80%
battery_aging:     P=85%, Confidence=75%
```

**Interpretation**: We're confident solar is NOT the cause, battery aging is likely

**What to do**: Focus on battery aging diagnosis

## Debugging Output

### No significant anomalies detected

**Cause**: Deviation threshold too high or nominal scenario incorrect

**Solution**:
```python
# Lower threshold
analyzer = ResidualAnalyzer(deviation_threshold=0.10)

# Or check nominal baseline
print(f"Nominal solar input: {nominal.solar_input}")
print(f"Degraded solar input: {degraded.solar_input}")
```

### All hypotheses equally likely

**Cause**: Causal graph is too disconnected or evidence is insufficient

**Solution**:
```python
# Check graph structure
for edge in graph.edges[:10]:
    print(f"{edge.source} -> {edge.target} (weight: {edge.weight})")

# Or inject stronger faults
power_deg = power_sim.run_degraded(solar_factor=0.3)  # 70% loss instead of 30%
```

### Hypothesis with mechanism but low probability

**Cause**: Hypothesis is plausible but not well-supported by evidence

**Solution**:
```python
# This is actually correct behavior - mechanism is good but evidence weak
# System is working as designed

# To increase probability, either:
# 1. Inject stronger faults
# 2. Lower deviation threshold
# 3. Adjust prior probabilities
```
