# Introduction to Pravaha

## What is Pravaha?

Pravaha is a **causal inference framework for diagnosing multi-fault failures in satellite systems**. Instead of using traditional threshold-based or correlation-based anomaly detection, Pravaha uses an explicit causal graph to reason about root causes in complex failure scenarios.

## The Problem

Satellite monitoring systems face a fundamental challenge: **multi-fault failures confuse simple detection methods**.

### Example: Solar Panel Degradation

When solar panels degrade:
1. **Direct effect**: Solar input decreases
2. **Secondary effect**: Battery charge decreases (less power available)
3. **Tertiary effect**: Battery temperature increases (longer discharge cycles)
4. **Observation**: Multiple sensors show anomalies simultaneously

A naive approach would report:
- "Low solar input" [OK]
- "Low battery charge" [OK]
- "High battery temperature" [NO] (correlation, but not the direct cause)

This leads to **false diagnoses** when:
- One root cause produces multiple observable deviations
- Different faults produce similar symptoms
- Cascading failures mask the original cause

## The Solution: Physics-Based Causal Reasoning

Pravaha solves this using an **explicit causal graph backed by aerospace physics**:

```
ROOT CAUSE (solar degradation)
    (down)
INTERMEDIATE (reduced solar input via physics equations)
    (down)
OBSERVABLE (low battery charge) <- AND -> (high battery temp)
```

This is NOT machine learning guessing. The graph encodes:
- **Aerospace Physics**: Power system dynamics (Kirchhoff's laws, battery models)
- **Thermal Engineering**: Heat transfer equations (radiation, conduction)
- **Domain Knowledge**: How failures propagate through actual satellite systems
- **Engineering Mechanisms**: Physically meaningful explanations for each causal link

Example: When solar input drops 100W, the physics simulation calculates:
- Battery discharge rate changes: dQ/dt = (P_load - P_solar) / C_battery
- Voltage drop: V(t) = V_nom * (SOC / 100) with nonlinear discharge curve
- Temperature rise: dT/dt = (Q_in - Q_rad) / (m * c) with Stefan-Boltzmann radiation

These aren't ML patterns. They're engineering equations.

Given observed deviations, Pravaha:
1. **Traces paths** from root causes -> intermediates -> observables
2. **Scores hypotheses** by consistency with the causal graph
3. **Ranks root causes** by posterior probability
4. **Explains mechanisms** (not just "probably X")

## Key Capabilities

### Multi-Fault Diagnosis

Detects multiple simultaneous failures (solar loss + battery aging) and disambiguates confounding effects through explicit causal reasoning.

### Transparent Reasoning

Every diagnosis shows:
- The physical mechanism causing the failure
- Confidence level based on evidence quality
- Which sensor readings support the conclusion

### Physics-Based Engineering (Not Machine Learning)

Built on actual aerospace physics:

**Power System Dynamics**
Kirchhoff's laws, battery discharge equations, charge control

**Thermal Engineering**
Stefan-Boltzmann radiation, heat transfer, conduction models

**Electrical Models**
Nonlinear battery curves, bus regulation, panel effects

**Sensor Physics**
Measurement noise, calibration drift, response characteristics

Unlike ML systems that learn patterns from data, Pravaha uses aerospace engineering equations. When solar panels degrade 30%, physics deterministically calculates what battery voltage and temperature MUST result.

### Production Ready

Pure Python core + optional Rust acceleration. CLI or library interface. Comprehensive test coverage.

## Why It's NOT Guessing: Physics-Based vs Data-Driven

**The Critical Difference:**

Traditional Machine Learning = Pattern Recognition (educated guessing)
```
Training data -> Neural network -> Find patterns -> Predict (may fail on unseen scenarios)
```

Pravaha = Aerospace Engineering with Physics Equations
```
Power equations -> Thermal equations -> Causal graph -> Deterministic diagnosis
```

**Why This Matters:**

1. **Physics is deterministic**: If solar input drops 100W, battery discharge rate MUST change by specific amount (dQ/dt equations don't lie)
2. **Works without training data**: Doesn't need datasets of failed satellites - physics works everywhere
3. **Impossible to hallucinate**: Can't make false correlations when reasoning through physical equations
4. **Proven equations**: Uses established aerospace engineering (Kirchhoff's laws, Stefan-Boltzmann radiation, battery chemistry)
5. **Transparent all the way**: Every conclusion traces back to real physics

Example comparison:
- ML approach: "In 95% of training data, solar + battery both degraded together, so probably solar" (pattern guessing)
- Pravaha: "Solar degradation -> reduces input power -> battery can't charge -> voltage drops AND temperature rises. This is what physics MUST produce." (engineering certainty)

## Why Causal Inference + Physics?

### Traditional Methods Fail

Comparison of approaches:

**Thresholds** (alert when value exceeds limit)
- Strength: Simple
- Weakness: Can't distinguish causes in multi-fault scenarios

**Correlation** (find which sensors move together)
- Strength: Detects patterns
- Weakness: Correlation does not equal causation

**Machine Learning** (learn from past failure data)
- Strength: Flexible patterns
- Weakness: Black box, requires thousands of training examples

**Physics + Causality** (Pravaha's approach)
- Strength: Deterministic engineering reasoning
- Weakness: Requires aerospace domain knowledge (already available)

Pravaha is the only method that uses actual physics equations instead of learned patterns or statistical correlations.

### Why Causal Graphs on Top of Physics?

Pearl's **do-calculus** enables us to:
- Reason about interventions ("what if we reduce power?")
- Predict unobserved states (dropout handling)
- Distinguish causes from effects

For satellites:
- Ground truth is expensive (real failures are rare)
- Simulation lets us validate the causal model
- Explicit reasoning matches operator intuition
- Transparency builds confidence in diagnosis
