"""
Power subsystem simulator for multi-fault satellite analysis.

This module generates realistic power telemetry by modeling:
1. Solar input with orbital eclipse cycles
2. Battery dynamics (charge/discharge with efficiency degradation)
3. Bus voltage regulation and sagging under load

We use physics based models (not machine learning) because:
1. Satellites have well understood power dynamics
2. Simulators must produce realistic ground truth for benchmarking
3. Domain experts (ISRO engineers) can validate the models
4. Physical models generalize to new satellite designs

The simulator supports fault injection:
- Solar panel degradation (dust, micrometeorite damage, thermal stress)
- Battery efficiency loss (cycling, age, thermal effects)
- Both can occur simultaneously to test multi-fault diagnosis

All parameters are tuned for an Indian Remote Sensing satellite (IRS-class).
